1) Do not modify the contents of this Translator app \Translator subfolder.  These are just for copying to target apps.
2) Copy the entire folder and it's contents to the target app root that you want to translate.
3) In the target app project, you can edit the Cache.json, Hints.json, Specials.json and XamlElements.json.
4) Initially, copy the \Translator\Resources.resw to target project. You won't need to do this again:
	\Strings\en-US\Resources.resw
	\Strings\de-DE\Resources.resw for German etc.
5) Do not deploy/distribute the target app \Translator folder and contents.  It is not needed.
